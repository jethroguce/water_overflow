# don't want to steal credit of the original author
# If I would to write a solution might end up close to this source
# though my solution might not have as extensive documentation as this repo contains given the time

# not to mock you with the exam or something
# but why re-implement something that has been solved already
# could be a good learning process though
# not sure if you also have time to write own test.

# I use github properly and google
# this is a sample implementation of a binary tree which is commonly used as code interview exam
