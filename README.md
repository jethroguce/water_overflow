# Water Overflow
This is the source code for the **Water Overflow** problem.  The goal of this repo is not only to provide an implementation for the solution, but also to demonstrate the approach and infrastructure (TDD, OOP, Documentation, etc).

## Problem Statement

> There is a stack of water glasses in a form of triangle as illustrated. Each glass has a 250ml capacity. When a liquid is poured into the top most glass any overflow is evenly distributed between the glasses in the next row. That is, half of the overflow pours into the left glass while the remainder of the overflow pours into the right glass.

> Write a program that is able to calculate and illustrate how much liquid is in the j-th glass of the i-th row when K litres are poured into the top most glass. The solution can be a command line tool or have a graphical interface.
